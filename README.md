Make sure you have Composer installed (https://getcomposer.org/download/), and then run: composer install
You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending on how you installed Composer.

Open up terminal and make sure you are in the root directory of the project.
Run: symfony console app:analizer <arg> for the code to run... 
Example: symfony console app:analizer input.txt

NOTE: The app also logs the same output to var/log/output.txt file.
